# Interactive Terminal Demo Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project aims to create an engaging, interactive terminal simulator that demonstrates Otium's AI-powered DevOps automation capabilities. The demo will simulate realistic user interactions, AI planning, approval workflows, and execution steps without requiring actual AI or backend infrastructure. Users will experience a guided, impressive demonstration of how Otium transforms complex DevOps tasks into simple natural language commands.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI presents a plan THEN the user SHALL be able to click "Approve" or "Modify" buttons
2. WHEN execution steps are running THEN they SHALL show detailed progress with expandable details
3. WHEN the demo completes THEN it SHALL show a summary of what was accomplished
4. WHEN viewing the terminal THEN it SHALL support realistic terminal features like scrolling and text selection
5. IF the user wants to interact THEN they SHALL be able to pause, restart, or skip to different parts of the demo

### Requirement 5
